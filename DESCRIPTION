Title: R package for calculating and decomposing hierarchical diversity across metrics and scales, from genes to ecosystem.
Description: Miscellaneous R functions for calculating multiple hierachical diversity metrics (especially for number of equivalent components), including hierarchial allleic richness, hierarchical heterozygosity, hierarchial D (q=1) and thier differentiation.
This package can allow you to analyse spatial structured genetic data under a unifying framework (Oscar E, et al, 2018), which partitions genetic diversity and differentiation into any hierarchial levels. It calculates and plots the diversity profiles (q=0,1,2). 
It can helps you easily set your structure and generate your structure dataframe. It can also calculates and plots the the correlation between geographic distance and genetic differentiation.
