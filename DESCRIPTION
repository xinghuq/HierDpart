Title: Partitioning Hierarchical Diversity and Differentiation Across Metrics and Scales, from Genes to Ecosystem
Description: Miscellaneous R functions for calculating and decomposing multiple hierarchical diversity metrics, including hierarchical allelic richness (q=1), hierarchical exponential Shannon entropy (q=1), hierarchical heterozygosity (q=2) and their differentiation. This package allows you to analyse spatial structured genetic data or species data under a unifying framework (Oscar E, et al, 2018), which partitions diversity and differentiation into any hierarchical levels. It helps you easily set the structure and generates structured dataframe. It produces diversity profiles (q=0,1,2), hierarchical diversity and differentiation, as well as the the correlation between geographic distance and genetic differentiation.
