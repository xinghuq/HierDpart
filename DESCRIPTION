Title: Partitioning Hierarchical Diversity and Differentiation Across Metrics and Scales, from Genes to Ecosystems
Description: Miscellaneous R functions for calculating and decomposing multiple hierarchical diversity metrics, including hierarchical allele richness (q=1), hierarchical exponential Shannon entropy (q=1), hierarchical heterozygosity (q=2) and genetic differentiations (Fst and Deta D). This package allows you to analyse spatial structured genetic data or species data under a unifying framework (Oscar OE, 2018. Evol Appl, 11:1176-1193), which partitions diversity and differentiation into any hierarchical levels. It helps you easily structure and format your data. It produces diversity profiles (q=0,1,2), hierarchical diversities and differentiations, as well as the the correlation between geographic distance and genetic differentiation.
